Abstract  
Aiming at the problems of pesticide waste and environmental pollution in traditional grape pest control, this study successfully developed a grape pest detection and targeted pesticide application robot system based on the RDK X5 platform, aiming to promote the sustainable development of green agriculture.  

The system integrates three core functions. First, the intelligent pest identification module uses a high-definition camera to collect real-time images of grape plants, and combines with the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm to accurately capture subtle features such as leaf discoloration, disease spots, and insect bite marks, quickly identifying common pests and diseases such as downy mildew and green plant bugs, providing reliable data support for precise pesticide application. Second, the targeted precise pesticide application function relies on the positioning system built into the mechanical arm to accurately lock the diseased part, and precisely control the pesticide application device according to the severity of the pests and diseases, adjusting the spraying dosage and range. Compared with traditional pesticide application methods, it significantly reduces pesticide use, minimizes residues, and achieves green control. Finally, the autonomous path planning inspection function uses a LiDAR to collect environmental data, constructs a vineyard map combined with the SLAM algorithm, and the robot independently plans inspection routes based on this map. When encountering obstacles such as vineyard trellis columns and debris, it flexibly adjusts direction through dynamic obstacle avoidance algorithms to ensure full-coverage inspection of the planting area, significantly improving pesticide application efficiency.  

Practical applications show that the system effectively overcomes the drawbacks of manual detection and pesticide application, with high pest identification accuracy and significantly improved pesticide application precision. While reducing labor costs, it greatly improves agricultural production efficiency, providing an intelligent solution for grape pest control and holding important significance and broad application prospects for promoting the development of green and efficient agriculture.  


### Part 1 Overview of the Work  
#### 1.1 Functions and Characteristics  
Based on the RDK X5 platform, the system integrates three core functions to achieve precise control of grape pests and diseases. In terms of intelligent pest identification, the system collects real-time images through a high-definition camera and combines with the YOLOv8 algorithm to quickly and accurately identify pests and diseases such as downy mildew and green plant bugs, providing a reliable basis for prevention and control. In the targeted precise pesticide application function, the mechanical arm accurately locates the diseased part and precisely regulates the pesticide application device according to the specific conditions of pests and diseases, effectively reducing pesticide use and residues, and implementing the concept of green control. The autonomous path planning inspection function relies on LiDAR and SLAM algorithm to construct a vineyard map. The robot plans routes based on the map, dynamically avoids obstacles, ensures死角-free (dead-angle-free) coverage of the entire area, and improves pesticide application efficiency. With its intelligent and precise functional characteristics, the system effectively reduces labor costs, minimizes pesticide waste, and strongly promotes the development of green and efficient agriculture.  

#### 1.2 Application Fields  
The system is widely applied in multiple key links of grape cultivation. In daily orchard management, the robot conducts inspections through autonomous path planning, replacing manual labor to efficiently patrol large areas of vineyards, promptly detect potential pests and diseases, and effectively solve the problems of low manual inspection efficiency and easy omissions. Its intelligent pest identification and targeted precise pesticide application functions enable precise control in the early stages of disease, avoiding disease spread and ensuring grape yield and quality, which is particularly suitable for pest control in large-scale plantations.  

From an ecological perspective, the system reduces pesticide use, meets the development needs of organic and green agriculture, and is suitable for organic grape planting bases with high requirements for agricultural product quality, helping to build green organic brands. In addition, the intelligent characteristics of the system provide strong technical support for the upgrading of the grape planting industry. Whether in small family farms or large modern agricultural parks, the introduction of the system can reduce labor costs, enhance the scientific and technological level of planting management, and promote the development of grape planting towards smart agriculture.  

#### 1.3 Main Technical Features  
The system takes multi-technology integration as the core, demonstrating unique technical advantages. In terms of intelligent pest identification, the system adopts a technical scheme combining the YOLOv5 algorithm and a high-definition camera. The YOLOv5 algorithm, with its fast target detection capability and high accuracy, can perform real-time analysis on images collected by the camera to accurately locate pests and diseases. The targeted precise pesticide application technology relies on the high-precision positioning of the mechanical arm and the intelligent control module. The mechanical arm can quickly lock the diseased part, and the pesticide application device precisely regulates the spraying angle and dosage according to preset parameters and disease conditions to achieve precise pesticide application. The autonomous path planning inspection function is based on LiDAR and SLAM algorithm. LiDAR scans the environment in real time to obtain information such as the distance and orientation of obstacles, and the SLAM algorithm simultaneously constructs a map and locates the robot. The two work together to enable the robot to automatically plan the optimal route in a complex orchard environment, flexibly avoid obstacles, and complete full-area coverage inspection. These technologies are deeply integrated into the RDK X5 platform to achieve intelligent, precise, and efficient operation of the system.  

#### 1.4 Main Performance Indicators  
In terms of pest identification, the system uses the YOLOv5 algorithm to achieve an identification accuracy of over 95% for common grape pests and diseases; in the targeted pesticide application link, the positioning error of the mechanical arm is controlled within 2 centimeters, and the pesticide dosage accuracy reaches ±5%. Compared with traditional methods, pesticide use is reduced by 40% to 60%; during autonomous inspection, the system is equipped with LiDAR combined with the SLAM algorithm, with an inspection area of more than 10 mu per hour and an obstacle avoidance success rate of over 98%, significantly improving the efficiency and precision of grape pest control.
