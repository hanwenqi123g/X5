# Grape Pest and Disease Detection and Targeted Pesticide Application Robot System Based on RDK X5

## Abstract
Aiming at the problems of pesticide waste and environmental pollution in traditional grape pest and disease control, this study successfully developed a grape pest and disease detection and targeted pesticide application robot system based on the RDK X5 platform, aiming to contribute to the sustainable development of green agriculture.

The system integrates three core functions. First, the intelligent pest and disease identification module collects real - time images of grape plants through a high - definition camera and combines with the YOLOv8 target detection algorithm to accurately capture subtle features such as leaf discoloration, disease spots, and insect bite marks, and quickly identify common pest and disease types such as downy mildew and green leafhoppers, providing reliable data support for precise pesticide application. Second, the targeted precise pesticide application function relies on the positioning system built into the robotic arm to accurately lock the diseased part. According to the severity of pests and diseases, it precisely controls the pesticide application device, adjusts the spraying dosage and range. Compared with traditional pesticide application methods, it greatly reduces the amount of pesticide used, reduces residues, and realizes green control. Finally, the autonomous path planning and inspection function uses lidar to collect environmental data, combines with the SLAM algorithm to build a vineyard map. The robot independently plans the inspection route based on this. When encountering obstacles such as grape trellis columns and debris, it flexibly adjusts the direction through the dynamic obstacle avoidance algorithm to ensure full - coverage inspection of the planting area and significantly improve the pesticide application efficiency.

Practical applications show that the system effectively overcomes many drawbacks of manual detection and pesticide application. It has a high accuracy rate of pest and disease identification and significantly improved pesticide application precision. While reducing labor costs, it greatly improves agricultural production efficiency, provides an intelligent solution for grape pest and disease control, and has important significance and broad application prospects for promoting the development of green and efficient agriculture.

## Part 1 Work Overview

### 1.1 Functions and Features
The system is based on the RDK X5 platform and integrates three core functions to achieve precise control of grape pests and diseases. In terms of intelligent pest and disease identification, the system collects real - time images through a high - definition camera and combines with the YOLOv5 algorithm, which can quickly and accurately identify pests and diseases such as downy mildew and green leafhoppers, providing a reliable basis for prevention and control work. In the targeted precise pesticide application function, the robotic arm accurately locates the diseased part and precisely regulates the pesticide application device according to the specific conditions of pests and diseases, effectively reducing the amount of pesticide used and residues, and implementing the concept of green control. The autonomous path planning and inspection function uses lidar and the SLAM algorithm to build a vineyard map. The robot plans the route according to the map, and can dynamically avoid obstacles when encountering them, ensuring full - area and dead - angle - free inspection, thus improving the pesticide application efficiency. With its intelligent and precise functional characteristics, the system effectively reduces labor costs, reduces pesticide waste, and strongly promotes the development of green and efficient agriculture.

### 1.2 Application Fields
The system has been widely used in multiple key links of grape planting. In daily orchard management, the robot conducts inspections through autonomous path planning, which can replace manual labor to efficiently inspect large - area vineyards, timely detect potential pests and diseases, and effectively solve the problems of low efficiency and easy omissions in manual inspection. Its functions of intelligent pest and disease identification and targeted precise pesticide application can achieve precise control in the early stage of diseases, avoid disease spread, thus ensuring the yield and quality of grapes, and is particularly suitable for pest and disease control in large - scale planting orchards.

From an ecological perspective, the system reduces the amount of pesticide used, meets the development needs of organic agriculture and green agriculture, and is suitable for organic grape planting bases with high requirements for agricultural product quality, helping to build green and organic brands. In addition, the intelligent characteristics of the system can also provide strong technical support for the upgrading of the grape planting industry. Whether it is a small family farm or a large - scale modern agricultural park, by introducing this system, labor costs can be reduced, the scientific and technological level of planting management can be improved, and the development of grape planting towards smart agriculture can be promoted.

### 1.3 Main Technical Features
The system takes multi - technology integration as the core and shows unique technical advantages. In terms of intelligent pest and disease identification, the system adopts a technical solution that combines the YOLOv8 algorithm and a high - definition camera. The YOLOv8 algorithm, with its fast target detection capability and high accuracy, can conduct real - time analysis of the images collected by the camera and accurately locate pests and diseases. The targeted precise pesticide application technology relies on the high - precision positioning and intelligent control module of the robotic arm. The robotic arm can quickly lock the diseased part, and the pesticide application device precisely regulates the spraying angle and dosage according to preset parameters and disease conditions to achieve precise pesticide application. The autonomous path planning and inspection function is based on lidar and the SLAM algorithm. The lidar scans the environment in real time to obtain information such as the distance and orientation of obstacles. The SLAM algorithm simultaneously builds a map and locates the robot. The two work together, enabling the robot to automatically plan the optimal route in the complex orchard environment, flexibly avoid obstacles, and complete the full - area coverage inspection. These technologies are deeply integrated into the RDK X5 platform, realizing the intelligent, precise, and efficient operation of the system.
